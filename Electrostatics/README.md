##  Electrostatic Field

Doug is fond of change, every now and then he tries to do new things. This time, he caught up with a rod comprising of negative (N) and positive (P) charges.
He is asked to calculate the maximum net electrostatic field possible in the region due to the rod.

Note: Assume Electrostatic Field = Total charge * 100

Input specification:

Input1: Integer array denoting the magnitude of each charge

Input2: String denoting nature of each charge ith represents a sign of charge at ithentry represents a sign of charge at ith location in input1

Input3: No of charges it holds (length of input1)

Output Specification:

Return the next maximum electrostatic field possible in the rod

Example 1:

Input1: {4,3,5}

Input2: PNP

Input3: 3

Output: 600

Example 2:

Input1: {2,3}

Input 2: PN

Input 3: 2

Output : 100

Explanation:
The maximum possible electric charge on the section of the rod is 2-3=-1 unit
